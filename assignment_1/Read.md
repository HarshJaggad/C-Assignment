# How to Compile and Run the C Program

## Step 1: Download and Install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Before compiling the C program, ensure that you have the GCC compiler installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official GCC website.

- [Download GCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcc-win64/)

Follow the installation instructions provided on the GCC website for your specific operating system.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/HarshJaggad/C-Assignment.git
```

## Step 3: Navigate to the Directory

Change your current working directory to the one containing the C file. If you cloned the repository, it might look like this:

```bash
cd C-Assignment
```


## Step 4: Compile and Run the C Program

Use the GCC compiler to compile the program. Here's an example command:

```bash
gcc Assignement1.c -o queue
```
This command compiles the Assignment1.c file and creates an executable named queue. After successfully compiling the program, you can run the executable:

```bash
./Assignment1
```
This command executes the compiled program, and you should see the menu-driven interface for interacting with the queue.

## Step 5: Interact with the Queue
Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations on the queue, including adding elements, removing elements, finding and removing elements, and printing the current state of the queue.

## Step 6: Exit the Program
When you are done interacting with the queue, choose the "Exit" option from the menu to exit the program.

## Summary

In summary, the steps to compile and run the C program are as follows:

#### 1. Download and install the GCC compiler from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcc-win64/.
#### 2. Clone the repository.
#### 3.Navigate to the directory containing the C file.
#### 4.Compile the C program using gcc.
#### 5.Run the compiled executable with ./queue.
#### 6.Interact with the queue using the on-screen menu.
#### 7.Exit the program when finished.
